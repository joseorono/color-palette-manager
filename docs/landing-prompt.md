Create a modern, sleek landing page for my Open-Source Project "Color Palette Manager".

Technical Requirements:
- Use Tailwind CSS and/or vanilla CSS only, no frameworks/libraries.
- No Shadcn UI or any other UI library.
- No external dependencies.
- Output must be valid HTML5 and use semantic tags (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>).
- Accessible, WCAG-compliant design.
- Style: clean, minimalist, and modern — similar to Apple’s landing pages, with generous white space and clear typography.

Non-Technical Requirements:
- The landing page should be modern and sleek.
- The landing page should be responsive.
- The Page must use the color palette of the project, the one I attached.
- It must have a footer with the project's name and a link to the GitHub repository.
- The Page must have a header with the project's name and a link to the GitHub repository.
- You need to use the logo I attached.

Layout:
  * Header
    + Project name.
    + Link to GitHub repository.
    + Sticky at the top with slight shadow.
  * Hero Section
    + Large project title.
    + Short description of the project.
    + Prominent “View on GitHub” button.
    + Optional screenshot or illustration.
  * Features Section
    + Highlight 3–4 main features of the project.
    + Use icons or simple illustrations.
  * Call-to-Action Section
    + Invite users to try/download the project.
    + Repeat GitHub link.
  * Footer
    + Project name and GitHub link.
    + Subtle background color from palette.
