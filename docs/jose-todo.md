# âœ… To-Do List


## Business Logic
- [ ] The `generateHarmoniousHexCsv` function should have different types of palette (receive a prop, with its type-safety) and should respect the locked colors.
    - [x] Create constants for the different types of palette.
    - [x] Create priority lists for all the different types of palettes.
    - [x] Create types to use in the UI to select the type of palette (including an object with PrettyName, Description, Icon and value).
- [x] Create a method that receives Color[] and gives me only the blocked colors.
- [x] Create math utils needed for tools and palette generation.
- [x] Add a noop to utils.
- [ ] Add an extra color called "muted" which is a gray for the descriptions.
