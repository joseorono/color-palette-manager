# üé® Color Palette Generator ‚Äì ToDo List

# First of All
- [ ] Fix Existing Functionality
- [ ] Enable PWA features
- [ ] Implement IndexedDB with Dexie.js (https://dexie.org/)
- [ ] The root `/app` directory should only contain route files. All other components should be moved to a separate `/components` directory, with layout components in their own `/layout` subdirectory.
- [ ] Implement Them Switcher in the Layout component (remember we're using Shadcn/UI's default theme system) - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/dark-mode/vite
- [ ] The index page should be a static landing page with marketing content, not the palette generator itself. The app itself should be moved to a separate route like `localhost:5173/app/`.

## üèó Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement **spacebar** trigger to generate random palettes
- [x] Add **lock color** feature to preserve selected colors while regenerating others
- [x] Ensure harmonization of newly generated colors with locked selections
- [x] Implement **export in multiple formats** (CSS, JSON, SVG, PNG, SCSS, Tailwind, DaisyUI, Shadcn/UI)
- [ ] Implement **import palettes** from supported formats
- [ ] Create **shareable link** functionality for palettes (like Coolors) - This is already implemented but it's too basic and doesn't share all the palette data, only the colors.
- [ ] Implement Color Naming using color name libraries or large JSON dataset.
- [ ] Implement Color Roles (Primary-light, Secondary-dark, Accent, Warning, etc.)
- [ ] Implement **Layout components** with their own directory.
